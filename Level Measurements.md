# Level Measurements

__*1.1  Defination*__

Level measurement is the determination of the linear vertical distance between a reference point that is the base of a holding container and the surface of the material in the holding container.

__*1.2 Units of Level Measurement*__

Units of level measurement are usually in **percent**. </br>

However, a level measurement of 0% does not necessarily mean that a vessel is empty and 100% does not necessarily mean that the vessel is full. The locations of 0% and 100% level measurements are typically determined by the instrument engineer based upon a number of considerations.

__*1.3 Why Level Measurement is necessary ?*__
</br>

In a plant, to assure the safety and profitability of processes, it is essential that plant is equipped with reliable and precise level measurement system.

Basically, level measurement is simply about determining the position of a surface inside a tank, reactor or another vessel.
One of the main purposes of the level measurement system is to measure inventory. In order to achieve good control, accurate measurement is a must. Accurate level measurement also increases efficiency. Suppose if a tank farm needs to keep a certain amount of material on hand at all times and the storage tanks are not filled to full capacity, the facility will incur the unnecessary expense of purchasing and maintaining additional storage vessels. Efficient use of storage space prevents the extra cost of needlessly acquiring more storage vessels.

All the level measurement system involves interaction between a sensing device, element, or system and a product inside the holding container.

#### Types of Level Measurement :
Two methods used to measure level are-

1. Direct or Mechanical methods
2. Indirect or Inferential methods.

___Direct level measurement___ is simple, almost straightforward and economical; it uses a direct measurement of the distance (usually height) from the datum line, and used primarily for local indication.
* a. __Dip Sticks and Lead Lines__ :
Flexible lines fitted with end weights called chains or lead lines have been used for centuries by seafaring men to gauge the depth of water under their ships. Although the dipstick and lead line method of level measurement are unrivalled in accuracy, reliability, and dependability, there are drawbacks to this technique like inability to successfully and conveniently measures level values in pressurized vessels and it requires an action to be performed, thus causing the operator to interrupt his duty to carry out this measurement.

* b. __Sight Glass__ :
Another simple method is called sight glass (or level glass). It is quite straightforward in use; the level in the glass seeks the same position as the level in the tanks. It provides a continuous visual indication of liquid level in a process vessel or a small tank and are more convenient than dip stick, dip rod and manual gauging tapes. The only drawback is that glass elements can get dirty and are susceptible to breakage thus presenting a safety hazard especially when hot, corrosive or flammable liquids are being handled.

* c. __Chain or Float Gauge__ :
The visual means of level measurement previously discussed are rivalled in simplicity and dependability by float type measurement devices. Float type of instruments mostly use the principal of  a buoyant element that floats on the surface of the liquid and changes position as the liquid level varies.
Many methods have been used to give an indication of level from a float position with the most common being a float and cable arrangements as shown in the figure:

___Indirect or inferred methods___ of level measurement depend on the material having a physical property which can be measured and related to level. Many physical and electrical properties have been used for this purpose and are well suited to producing proportional output signals for remote transmission.

Included in these methods are;

A. __Buoyancy__ :-
the force produced by a submerged body which is equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.

B. __Hydrostatic head__ :-
the force or weight produced by the height of the liquid.

C. __Sonar or ultrasonic__ :-
materials to be measured reflect or affect in a detectable manner high frequency sound signals generated at appropriate locations near the measured material.

D. __Microwave__ :-
similar to ultrasonic but uses microwave instead of ultrasonic beam.

E. __Conductance__ :-
at desired points of level detection, the material to be measured conducts (or ceases to conduct) electricity between two fixed probe locations or between a probe and vessel wall.

F. __Capacitance__ :-
the material to be measured serves as a variable dielectric between two fixed capacitor plates. In reality, there are two substances which form the dielectric -the material whose measurement is desired and the vapor space above it.

The total dielectric value change as the amount of one material increases while the other decreases.

G. __Radiation__ :-
the material measured absorbs radiated energy. As in the capacitance method, vapor space above the measured material also has an absorbing characteristics, but the difference in absorption between the two is great enough that the measurement can be related quite accurately to measured material.

H. __Weight__: :-
the force due to weight can be related very closely to level when its density is constant. Variable concentrations components or temperature variations present difficulties, however.

I. __Resistance__ :-
Pressure of the measured material squeezes two narrowly separated conductor together, reducing overall circuit resistance in an amount proportional to level.

J. __Micro-Impulse__ :-
“time-of-flight”, electrical pulses launch and travels back in frequency directly proportional to the level of the liquid.
