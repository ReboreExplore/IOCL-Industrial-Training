# Level Measurements

__*1.1  Defination*__

Level measurement is the determination of the linear vertical distance between a reference point that is the base of a holding container and the surface of the material in the holding container.

__*1.2 Units of Level Measurement*__

Units of level measurement are usually in **percent**. </br>

However, a level measurement of 0% does not necessarily mean that a vessel is empty and 100% does not necessarily mean that the vessel is full. The locations of 0% and 100% level measurements are typically determined by the instrument engineer based upon a number of considerations.

__*1.3 Why Level Measurement is necessary ?*__
</br>

In a plant, to assure the safety and profitability of processes, it is essential that plant is equipped with reliable and precise level measurement system.

Basically, level measurement is simply about determining the position of a surface inside a tank, reactor or another vessel.
One of the main purposes of the level measurement system is to measure inventory. In order to achieve good control, accurate measurement is a must. Accurate level measurement also increases efficiency. Suppose if a tank farm needs to keep a certain amount of material on hand at all times and the storage tanks are not filled to full capacity, the facility will incur the unnecessary expense of purchasing and maintaining additional storage vessels. Efficient use of storage space prevents the extra cost of needlessly acquiring more storage vessels.

All the level measurement system involves interaction between a sensing device, element, or system and a product inside the holding container.

#### Types of Level Measurement :
Two methods used to measure level are-

1. Direct or Mechanical methods
2. Indirect or Inferential methods.

Direct level measurement is simple, almost straightforward and economical; it uses a direct measurement of the distance (usually height) from the datum line, and used primarily for local indication.
* a. __Dip Sticks and Lead Lines__ :
Flexible lines fitted with end weights called chains or lead lines have been used for centuries by seafaring men to gauge the depth of water under their ships. Although the dipstick and lead line method of level measurement are unrivalled in accuracy, reliability, and dependability, there are drawbacks to this technique like inability to successfully and conveniently measures level values in pressurized vessels and it requires an action to be performed, thus causing the operator to interrupt his duty to carry out this measurement.
