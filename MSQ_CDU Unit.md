# CDU Unit of the Refinery

The production of the valuable petroleum products of the refinery goes through a series of different **primary** and **secondary** processing units along with the associated **auxiliary facilities** like Captive Power Plant installed within the refinery.

***Operation of the Crude Distillation Unit***

The primary unit of the Refinery is the Crude Distillation Unit (CDU).In this unit desalted crude from the desalter is heated up through a series of heat exchangers and is fed into a pre fractionator column.

Here the lighter gases, LPG and unstabilized gasoline are separated. The outputs from CDU are *gasoline, Kero-I, Kero-II and Straight Run Gas Oil*. *Reduced Coke Oil (RCO)* which is the bottom product from the main fractionating column, forms the main raw material for Coking unit and INDMAX. In Naphtha Splitter section, total Straight Run Naphtha is separated into three different fractions namely Light Naphtha (LN), Reformate Naphtha (RN) and Heavy Naphtha (HN).

As instrumentation engineers we usually don't deal with the core chemical processes involved in the Crude Distillation Unit rather we do the control operations using PLC(Programmable Logic Controller) and DCS(Distributed Control System).
