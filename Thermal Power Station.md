# Thermal Power Station

 **History**

Thermal power station(TPS) of Guwahati Refinery was commissioned in 1962 with the
collaboration of Romanian Govt. Initially, it was having 4 Romanian boilers of 20 tons/hr capacity each, two nos. of Romanian Generators of 3 MW capacity each and water
softening plant for supplying the treated water to the boilers and refinery. During the course of 40 years, following changes were made
* 1985: Generator # 3 was commissioned of 8 MW capacity.
* 1986: Once through cooling water system has been converted to re-circulating system.
* 1992: Boiler #5 was commissioned of capacity 40 tons/hr.
* 1993: Water softening plant has been replaced by DM plant.
* 1998: TG #4 was commissioned.
* 2002: 3rd chain of DM plant commissioned.
* 2004: TG #3 and TG #4 MMI upgraded from ECIL make to ABB make.
* 2005: TG #5 was commissioned (12 MW capacity)
* 2005: TPS cooling tower reinnovated.
* 2006: STG #5 commissioned.
* 2006: Deaerator 1 and 2 condemned and removed.
* 2007: Rumanian boiler #2 condemned and removed.

#### ***About TPS of Guwahati Refinery***

The Thermal Power Station of the Guwahati Refinery is of capacity 28MW.This unit is extensively used for generation of electricity and steam generation for all its units.
As given in the specifications it has three steam turbines.

Its Operation is based on Rankine cycle  which states that : *Water is heated into steam and spins a steam turbine which either drives an electrical generator. After it passes through the turbine the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated.*
