# DCU Unit of the Refinery

The main secondary unit of the Guwahati Refinery is the Delayed Coking Unit (DCU) with a capacity of 0.44 MMTPA.

 The unit produces middle distillates from heavy ends. Main feedstock to DCU is *Reduced Crude Oil*, which is heated to high temperatures of about 500â„ƒ in a furnace. Due to high temperatures, RCO is thermally cracked and yields various hydrocarbon fractions like LPG, Coker gasoline, Coker kerosene, Coker gas oil, Coker fuel oil, residual fuel oil and coke.

Refinery INDMAX unit, in-house technology developed by R&D Centre of Indian Oil was installed for increased production of LPG and gasoline from heavy ends like Reduced Crude Oil and Coker Fuel Oil. INDMAX unit works on the Fluidized Catalytic Cracking process similar to other Fluidized Catalytic Cracking Units. The first commercial unit based on INDMAX technology was installed at Guwahati Refinery with a capacity of 0.1 MMTPA, and the capacity was subsequently enhanced to 0.15 MMTPA. Besides its function of maximization of LPG, it enables the Refinery to upgrade its residual products to high value distillate products.
