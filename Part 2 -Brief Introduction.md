## Brief Introduction

Instrumentation Engineers mainly focus on the measurements to be taken to keep the processes in the plant under control or to be more precise on the safer side of working.</br>

We start this journey by having a very basic understanding of the various basic instruments and its measurements prior to any startup, shutdown or emergency situation occurring in a plant and also taking out the control action in as efficient way as possible.</br>

The various types of measurements to be covered in this unit are :

* _Pressure Measurements_
* _Level Measurements_
* _Flow Measurements_
* _Temperature Measurements_

IOCL, Guwahati has the Instrumentation Department taking care of all such situations and employing various electrical and electronics instruments to ensure safety and efficiency of the plant. The details about each technology is discussed elaborately in this repository.</br>

In the workshop sessions during the internship period we were shown the cross sections of the various instruments and its internal working in the Electronics Laboratory.</br>

_Since mobile phones were not allowed providing pictures of the same from the lab will not be possible in this discussion. However I shall try to give equivalent images in every reference I provide._
