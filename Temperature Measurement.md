# Temperature Measurement

___Definition___ :
Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles that make up a body. The greater the kinetic energy of the particles is, the higher the temperature of the body will be or we can define temperature as the ability of one body to transfer thermal energy to another body i.e. If two bodies are in thermal equilibrium and no thermal energy is exchanged, the bodies are at the same temperature.

___Units of Measurement___

Heat is measured in Joules or Calories and Temperature is measured in Celsius and Fahrenheit.
S.I unit of Temperature is Kelvin.

Important Conversions:

째F = (9/5)째C + 32

째K = 273.15 + 째C

___Why Temperature Measurement is necessary?___

Temperature is one of the most important measurement parameters that is used for monitoring and control in various industries.  Manufacturing processes that are affected by temperature are referred to as thermal systems.
