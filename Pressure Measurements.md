# Pressure Measurements


1.1 *__Units of Pressure Measurements__*


* 1 Pascal(1N/m2) = 10dyne/cm2
* 1mmHg = 133.32 pascals
= 13.595mm Water
* 1 atm = 1.013 * 10^5 N/m2
* 1 millibar = 1000 dyn/cm2
* 1 micron = 10^-6 mHg
* 1 torr = 1 mmHg
= 1000micron
* 1 atm = 760 mmHg = 10^4 mmH20 = 1 kgf/cm2

*The standard SI unit for pressure measurement is Pascal (Pa).*

1.2 *__Why and Where are these Pressure Measurements necessary ?__* </br>
* Pressure is measured by the force acting on unit area. Measuring devices used in these plants usually indicate _differential pressure_ i.e. in relation with atmospheric pressure. This is called _gauge pressure_. The measured pressure may be positive or negative with reference to the atmospheric pressure .
The various ways pressure measurements becomes absolutely necessary are :
1. The pressure of steam in a boiler is measured for ensuring safe operating condition of the boiler.
2. Pressure measurement helps in determining the liquid level in tanks and containers.
3. Pressure measurement helps in determining the density of liquids.
4. In many flow meter (such as venturimeter, orifice meter, flow nozzle, etc.,) pressure measurement serves as an indication of flow rate.
5. Measurement of pressure change becomes an indication of temperature (as used in pressure thermometers-fluid expansion type).

_and many more such basic as well as important applications._

1.3 *__Pressure Measuring Devices__*

1. Pressure Gauge
* A pressure gauge is a fluid(gas or liquid) intensity measurement device. Pressure gauges are required for the set-up and tuning of fluid power machines, and without pressure gauges, fluid power systems would be both unpredictable and unreliable. Gauges help to ensure there are no leaks or pressure changes that could affect the operating condition of the system we are handling.</br>

These pressure gauges are installed anywhere on the machine where pressure needs to be monitoredâ€”especially if sub-circuits operate at a pressure rate different from pump pressure. Similarly pneumatic and compressed air systems are also rife with gauges, as pressure is also measured in many locations throughout the system. Typically, pneumatic pressure gauges are rated for not much more than 300 psi(typical systems run at around 100 psi) and Hydraulic pressure gauges are available to measure up to 10,000 psi(typical systems run at around 3000-5000 psi).
* There are many types of gauge styles, the most common being Bourdon tubes and bellow gauges. Bourdon tubes function by taking the pressure and converting it into mechanical energy. This energy moves a dial in the gauge, displaying the current amount of pressure in the system. Typical pressure is around 3-15 psi and the output current is calibrated to 4mA-20mA.

Bourdon tube operation is simple. They consist of a semicircular and flat tube of metal, fixed at one end and attached to a sensitive lever mechanism at the other. As pressure increases inside the tube, the force of the fluid attempts to straighten out the curved tube. The tube then pulls away from the lever, which being connected to the needle on the display, shows the pressure at the fluid port.
