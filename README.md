# Summer-Industrial-Training
A month long compulsory Industrial Exposure as a part of my Undergraduate Degree in Instrumentation Engineering.


This internship was successfully completed in the month of June-July, 2019 in the INDIAN OIL CORPORATION LTD (IOCL,Noonmati). This internship required us to work under 
our assigned guides under the assigned departments (*I was working under the Instrumentation Department*). For the first one week we did literature review on the subjects
and in the following weeks we were taught about the functioning of the various sub departments under Instrumentation and Control. Since we were not allowed any camera's
or phones inside the campus I tried to divide the things which were covered into sub-parts and compile all in this repository.
